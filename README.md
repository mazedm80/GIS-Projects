# Famous food of Dhaka
![](images/popular_food_BD.png)

The project goal was to creat an ArcGIS story map in the ArcGIS online platform.The story map is about famous food of Dhaka, Bangladesh.
The story map contain following features:
- The area of interest map overlay
- Variable visiblity of the point of interest
- A legend with custom icons and categoty
- Popup to each point with few variable attributes like:
    - Restaurant Type
    - Price
    - Opening hours
    - Name
- Lastly a route map

# Making tree inventory and virtual plot using LiDAR and UAV data
![](images/tree_inventory.png)

The project was divided into two tasks:
1. A pine tree inventory from LiDAR and UAV data.
2. Create a virtual sample plot with a radius of 12.62 m

## Task 1:
1. Generate and calculate CHM_LiDAR base on the difference between DTM_LiDAR and
DSM_LiDAR
2. Generate and calculate CHM_UAV base on the difference between DTM_LiDAR and
DSM_UAV
3. Make a trees segmentation base on CHM_UAV and CHM_LiDAR and calculate:
    - The number of trees
    - The maximum, minimum and mean height (TH)
    - The mean diameter of crowns
    - The mean crown area and the histogram of crown areas
    - The mean DBH (Diameter at breast height) base on the formula for the pine height
(TH) expressed by: `ùê∑ùêµùêª = 0.3029 ‚àó ùëáùêª^{1.47225}`
4. Create a comparison of the above results between CHM_UAV and CHM_LiDAR
    - UAV tree inventory result can be found here [UAV DATA](results/UAV_all.xlsx)
    - LiDAR tree inventory result can be found here [LiDAR DATA](results/LiDar_all.xlsx)

## Task 2:
1.  Calculate Laser Penetration Index (LPI) base on the total number of ground points from
LiDAR data (GR) and the total number of all points from LiDAR data (AR)
`LPI = GR/AR`
2. Add a one random point within the extend and create a virtual sample plot with a radius of 12.62 m
3. Calculate all metrics for the plot base on the segmentation mentioned in point number 3 of task 1 and
 for LiDAR data only
    - The result can be found here [Virtual Plot DATA](results/UAV_AOI.xlsx)
4. Virtually cut all the trees and create solar radiation presentation for this artificial gap,
5. Create a final layout with the results of all the calculation.

# Comparison of GNSS, GPS and Mobile GPS and its error in the Forest environment
![](images/GNSS.png)
The task is to visulization of point which are recorded from GNSS, GPS corrected, GPS uncorrected and Mobile GPS devices in a forest path.
- There are 25 reference point and in each point data were recorded from ths mentioned devices
- In every point take a picture of the skyview
- Compare the error of the devices to the reference points
- Show a statistical comparison between the devices
- The [Excel table](results/reference_with_distance.dbf.xlsx) is exported from ArcGIS attribute table and the furture modified

# Photovoltaic cost analysis for selected urban areas in Warsaw
![](images/photovoltanic.jpg)
The task is to process a LiDAR data from an urban area for locating photovoltanic site and a cost analysis for photovoltanic palenls.
the project requirements is as follows:
- Crop the las file to a with dimensions of 200x200 meters
- The raster resolution should be 20x20 meters
- Aspect should be within 112,5 to 247,5 degrees

The task is done in ArcGIS using [LAStools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/) toolbox. The full workflow is given below

# Find location for timber yard, which must be in the area where all following conditions are satisfied:
- Forest with _Birch_ tree species
- Forest with _Fresh pine/coniferous forest_ site type
- Forest with _acidic_ soil
- Located 130 m aboce see level (avoide possible flood region)
- Located within 3200 m (driving through road network) from _Woroszyly_ town

The final output after all the analysis looks like below image:
